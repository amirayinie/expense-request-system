Step 4: Seed Dummy Users (Optional)

🏦 Bank Gateway Detection
The system uses the second and third digits of the IBAN to detect which gateway to use:

IBAN Prefix	Bank Gateway
IR12	Bank1
IR22	Bank2
IR33	Bank3

Each gateway is encapsulated in its own class and follows the PayableInterface contract.

🔄 Scheduled Auto Payment
Uses Laravel's scheduler to auto-pay approved, unpaid requests daily at 8:00 AM.

Registered in bootstrap/app.php:

use App\Jobs\AutoPayApprovedExpenses;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schedule;

Schedule::job(new AutoPayApprovedExpenses)->dailyAt('08:00');
You must run the scheduler with:


php artisan schedule:run
🧩 Extending the System
To add a new bank gateway: create a class in App\Services\Payment\Gateways and implement PayableInterface.

Add its IBAN prefix to the $map in PaymentController.

⚠️ Notes
Actual payment and SMS APIs are stubbed. Replace with real integrations if needed.

SMS sending code is marked via comments inside NotificationService.
